#Owner Free File System in Javascript
##Status: Rebooting
is a peer-to-peer distributed file system in which all shared files are represented by randomized multi-used data blocks. Instead of anonymizing the network, the data blocks are anonymized and therefore, only data garbage is ever exchanged and stored and no forwarding via intermediate nodes is required.

 p1 = s1 xor b1
 s1 = p1 xor b1
 b1 = p1 xor s1
